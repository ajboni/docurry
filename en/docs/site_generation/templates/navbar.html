        <article class="docs-content" id="docs-content-container"><h2 id="navbar">Navbar <a class="header-anchor" href="#navbar">¶</a></h2>
<p>Navbar can have a search box and buttons.</p>
<p>To enable search box just set <code>ENABLE_SEARCH</code> setting.
Similar to <a href="sidebar">manual sidebar</a> you can provide a <code>navbar.json</code> with the following content:</p>
<pre class="hljs"><label class="language-caption">json</label><code data-lang="json">[
  {
    <span class="hljs-attr">"caption"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"Github"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">"url"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"https://github.com"</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">"class"</span>: <span class="hljs-string">"btn-primary"</span>
  }
]
</code></pre>
<p>The result will be something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/img/navbar-example.jpg" alt="Navbar"></p>
