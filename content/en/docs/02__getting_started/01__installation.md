# Installation

The installation is really simple:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:ajboni/docurry.git`.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Have a look at `config.js` and set up your project.
4. Replace `content` folder considering the [folder structure](/en/docs/getting_started/folder_structure) and [naming rules](/en/docs/file_names.html)
