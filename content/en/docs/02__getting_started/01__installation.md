# Installation

The installation process is really simple:

1. Use the template `https://github.com/ajboni/docurry/generate` or just download the repo
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Have a look at `config.js` and set up your project.
4. Replace `content` folder considering the [folder structure](/en/docs/getting_started/folder_structure) and [naming rules](/en/docs/file_names.html)
