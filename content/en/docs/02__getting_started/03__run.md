# Running development environment.

To run the development environment: `npm run dev`.

The server will track changes on both the frontend and markdown files and should live reload the browser on any changes.

> Live reload is WIP and might not work as expected, specially when changing source files. If no changes are shown, try re-running `npm run dev`.  
> Sorry for the trouble 🙏
