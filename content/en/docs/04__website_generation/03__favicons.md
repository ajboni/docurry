# Favicons

Auto generate favicons for all platforms.

## Source File.

Source file for the favicon must be an image file and specified in

Favicon generation might time some time, so Docurry will only generate them if there is no `.cache/favicons` folder.
To force regeneration of favicons simply delete that folder and re-run the build process.
