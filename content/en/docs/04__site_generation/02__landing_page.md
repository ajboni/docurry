# Landing Page

Docurry will auto generate a landing page according to the info on README.md
To override the behavior simply create a index.md in your `content/{language}` folder: eg: `content/en/index.md`
Some special rules applies to this template:

- `<h5>` `#####` tags shows up big and centered, useful for showing emojis.
- Ordered lists `<ol>` shows up vertically stacked without list style.
- Unordered lists `<ul>` creates buttons for every entry and they are showed stacked horizontally. Intended to be used to create buttons with links.
- `<blockqoute>` `>` shows as a subtitle.

Example:

```Markdown

## Background Generation

If you want to provide your own background set the path on `config.LANDING_PAGE_BG`. It will be converted to jpg and copied to `BUILD_FOLDER/img/bg.jpg`

If you set `config.LANDING_PAGE_BG` to `auto` Docurry will auto generate the background using [trianglify](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify)

> Make sure to read [trianglify license](https://github.com/qrohlf/trianglify#licensing) and make sure your project complies with it.

Each time the site is built, a new background will be generated.
