# Why?

There are plenty of static sites generators, why make Docurry?

The project was born when I needed a quick, zero config doc site for one of my projects. 
I Found popular static site generators a little bit too much and quickly found the awesome [docsify](https://docsify.js.org) project.

Unfortunately at that time there was no static export options and navigation was made via a router. This makes SEO a little bit more complicated and md files are parsed at runtime.

This project aims to be as simple as 1-2-3 and the output should be a standard static html site.
